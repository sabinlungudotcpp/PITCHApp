The poor educational outcomes result from wide gaps in education, particularly from a poor translation of education pedagogy to practice. The importance of play and physical development has been lost in the educational institutions and even more so in undeserved communities as there is an unofficial attention to didactic education.\nThis lack of focus on sport and play has been attributed as one of the singular most important cause of poor school performance and drop-out. This has also led to the marginalization of girls in under-served communities.",

We would like to implement the project in 20 schools of above mentioned cities",

We found that teachers from these schools, had difficulties retaining the attention of the students long enough to impact learning. As a result a bulk of these studnets start falling back in studies as early as 4th class. For most of the students attending these schools it is a daily struggle to eevn come to the school given their economic and social background.\nOur experience and interactions with local community have shown us that these school and their students, with no sporting facilities are marginalised on multiple levels",
