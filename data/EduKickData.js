The poor educational outcomes result from wide gaps in education, particularly from a poor translation of education pedagogy to practice. The importance of play and physical development has been lost in the educational institutions and even more so in undeserved communities as there is an unofficial attention to didactic education.\nThis lack of focus on sport and play has been attributed as one of the singular most important cause of poor school performance and drop-out. This has also led to the marginalization of girls in under-served communities.",

The proposed impact however does not exist to direct beneficiaries of the project but also teachers and coaches at the school. This project is an innovation in a way it uses technology very uniquely.\nThe use of sport to teach life skills is nothing new, however, sports being used to increase educational outcome is just being considered a pedagogical tool with many implications.",

Furthermore, it alsso has games designed on child rights, language, football skills, health and hygiene etc. Through this program, we target children coming from slum areas and villages where they do not get good primary education and as a result they are ignored by the mainstream society.\nBy using this program we would like to work on one of the MDG of UN which says that every child has a right to primary education and it also comes under the right to education act in the constitution of India."
