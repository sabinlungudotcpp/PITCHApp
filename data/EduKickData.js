The poor educational outcomes result from wide gaps in education, particularly from a poor translation of education pedagogy to practice. The importance of play and physical development has been lost in the educational institutions and even more so in undeserved communities as there is an unofficial attention to didactic education.\nThis lack of focus on sport and play has been attributed as one of the singular most important cause of poor school performance and drop-out. This has also led to the marginalization of girls in under-served communities.",
