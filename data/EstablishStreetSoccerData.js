        "street_soccer_description": "The expression Street Soccer can mean many things, for the purposes of this programme, Street Soccer is a programme that engages with any group or mix of groups of disadvantaged adults from a variety of backgrounds; the programme will be free of charge to these players with the aim of improving their confidence, creating a structure, aiding personal development, increasing their team building capacity amongst many other benefits.\nPlaying football is the hook that brings the players together but it is not the main purpose of the programme initially, the aim is to help the players make positive changes in their lives."

        "target_group_text": "When considering establishing a Street Soccer programme thought needs to be given to the target groups that the programme will be providing for. This could be different depending on the demographics and need of the area, and could vary between cities, regions and countries. If the idea of participating in a specific tournament such as the Homeless World Cup or Street Child World Cup is appealing to you, consideration should be given to the numbers involved in the target area that meet the criteria.\nIf the area you are thinking of has multiple issues then having an open door policy to enable as many people to participate could be the answer, however this could bring other issues such as area conflict, cultural issues so consider all these points prior to starting, so it is very important to do initial research and spend some time in the area speaking to local people and organisations."

        "existing_sessions_text": "Some areas may have existing sport programmes that provide an outlet and opportunity for the people in the area. There could also be football programmes/clubs who exist in the area, however it is likely that if they are Clubs they will expect their players to pay to play. If there are existing free sport sessions it is necessary to establish a SS programme here or should you approach them for potential partner working to offer more sessions or to reach a different group."

        "partnerships_text": "As mentioned above, partnerships with existing sports or football clubs can be beneficial to share costs, workloads and contacts. In areas where there are social issues there are normally existing organisations and programmes established to provide the support and services for the people of the area, it is important when researching the feasibility of establishing a Street Soccer programme to make contact with these organisations, ideallt with the people on the front line",
        "partnerships_text_sub": "In making this contact it allows you to identify the key issues and people most in need in order that you confirm your thoughts on the target group it also allows you to promote the benefits of attending your programme for the community and the people involved, if you are successful in selling the idea these workers will promote your sessions and encourage participation with the people and families they work with.\nIdeally you should be able to promote these organisations to your attendees, this will provide 2 way benefits for the organisations plus it will help the community develop and grow positively."

        "facilities_text": "Not every area has perfect playing facilities with all the amenities therefore when establishing where to host your sessions you need to consider where your target audience are available. The session should ideally be in the area that is within walking or cycling distance to the majority of your audience. The area itself should be flat and safe, do not be put off if the area needs to be cleared of grass/weeds/shrubs, this can be carried out by the participants under your supervision which in turn will enhance and improve the community, the size of the area will dictate the number of active participants you can work with. If there is a school or community building in the area could the kit be stored there?"

        "coaches_text": "When initially establishing a Street Soccer programme you will most likely be involved in the coaching personally however there is a need to recruit new coaches to provide cover or to grow the programme. The coach is the first point of contact for your organisation and must therefore promote the best possible impression for the participants, as a result the level of coaching is not the priority but the way in which they interact with the players and support them in Street Soccer the football is only about 35% it is the personal development that makes up the rest.\nSo when recruiting coaches' consideration should be given to promoting players from the programme as they will understand the programe they will be able to relate to the players and they will feel part of the organisation."

        "recruitment_text": "Working with existing organisations in the community will give you contact with programmes that already engage with people from the community who may have become peer leaders and therefore could be trained as coaches to lead sessions or to be involved in the programem as a support worker. Local colleges or clubs may have people who want to support their community and want to gain experience in coaching for their career, if you find someone from there you need to ensure that they understand the purpose of Street Soccer and that the interaction with the player is the most important element"

        "timing_text": "The timing of the session should be driven by the availablity of the target audience, if the majority are free in the mornings then the session should be then if a facility is available consider that there is no point in holding a session at a time of day or on a day when the target group are available. Initial research should be carried out to clarify this."

        "kit_description": "When establishing a Street Soccer session there is no need to have a brand new fully equipped kit, it would be nice to have! But to start a session a few balls, some markers, some bibs and a couple of goals is sufficient. It may be worthwhile contacting local schools or colleges for kit donations, or approaching local businesses for donations to purchase kit."

        "funding_text": "This is probably going to be the biggest issue in establishing a sustainable Street Soccer programme, from experience I can advise that there is almost certainly going to be a need to deliver a programme with no support or funding in the first few months in order to demonstrate to potential funders the benefits of running a programme. The sources of funding can vary from city to city and country to country.\n This needs to be researched fully and explored with the support of experienced Street Soccer experts, local NGO's or Government sources. When considering funding you need to be inventive and consider all avenues and sources, you should consider how you approach potential funders and why they should support or invest in you, this enables you to sell the concept easier."

        "me_text": "Monitoring and evaluation is probably not at the top of your considerations when starting out however if you can identify and report on the benefits of Street Soccer from day 1 this provides you with evidence to gain further support. Simple things such as the numbers attending; player feedback, improved life skills, fitness improved; community feedback through observations and interviews will impress potential supporters with information that they can review to establish why they should invest in the programme."

        "supportstaff_description": "Once a street soccer programme is up and running with a regularly attending group there will be a need to look at 'other' staff to support off the pitch the work the coaches are doing on the pitch this can include the administration of the programme including M & E; offering support to the participants; recruiting new participants. These staff could be volunteers in the first instance however you may need to look for people who have specific skills who can enhance the programme and make your work easier."
