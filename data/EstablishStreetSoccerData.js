        "street_soccer_description": "The expression Street Soccer can mean many things, for the purposes of this programme, Street Soccer is a programme that engages with any group or mix of groups of disadvantaged adults from a variety of backgrounds; the programme will be free of charge to these players with the aim of improving their confidence, creating a structure, aiding personal development, increasing their team building capacity amongst many other benefits.\nPlaying football is the hook that brings the players together but it is not the main purpose of the programme initially, the aim is to help the players make positive changes in their lives."

        "target_group_text": "When considering establishing a Street Soccer programme thought needs to be given to the target groups that the programme will be providing for. This could be different depending on the demographics and need of the area, and could vary between cities, regions and countries. If the idea of participating in a specific tournament such as the Homeless World Cup or Street Child World Cup is appealing to you, consideration should be given to the numbers involved in the target area that meet the criteria.\nIf the area you are thinking of has multiple issues then having an open door policy to enable as many people to participate could be the answer, however this could bring other issues such as area conflict, cultural issues so consider all these points prior to starting, so it is very important to do initial research and spend some time in the area speaking to local people and organisations."

There could also be football programmes/clubs who exist in the area, however it is likely that if they are Clubs they will expect their players to pay to play. If there are existing free sport sessions it is necessary to establish a SS programme here or should you approach them for potential partner working to offer more sessions or to reach a different group."

In areas where there are social issues there are normally existing organisations and programmes established to provide the support and services for the people of the area, it is important when researching the feasibility of establishing a Street Soccer programme to make contact with these organisations, ideallt with the people on the front line",
        "partnerships_text_sub": "In making this contact it allows you to identify the key issues and people most in need in order that you confirm your thoughts on the target group it also allows you to promote the benefits of attending your programme for the community and the people involved, if you are successful in selling the idea these workers will promote your sessions and encourage participation with the people and families they work with.\nIdeally you should be able to promote these organisations to your attendees, this will provide 2 way benefits for the organisations plus it will help the community develop and grow positively."
